# To minimize errors when writing long texts with
# complicated expressions you could replace 
# the tricky parts with a marker. 
# Write a program that takes a line of text and 
# finds the first occurrence of a certain marker 
# and replaces it with a replacement text. 
# The resulting line of text should be stored in a variable. 
# All input data will be given as variables.
#
# Replace the first occurrence of marker in the line below.
# There will be at least one occurence of the marker in the
# line of text. Put the answer in the variable 'replaced'.
# Hint: You can find out the length of a string by command
# len(string). We might test your code with different markers!

# Example 1
marker = "AFK"
replacement = "away from keyboard"
line = "I will now go to sleep and be AFK until lunch time tomorrow."

# Example 2 # uncomment this to test with different input
#marker = "EY"
#replacement = "Eyjafjallajokull"
#line = "The eruption of the volcano EY in 2010 disrupted air travel in Europe for 6 days."

###
# YOUR CODE BELOW. DO NOT DELETE THIS LINE
###

marker_position =  line.find(marker)
replaced = line[:marker_position] + replacement + line[marker_position + len(marker):]

print replaced

# Example 1 output should be:
#>>> I will now go to sleep and be away from keyboard until lunch time tomorrow.
# Example 2 output should be:
#>>> The eruption of the volcano Eyjafjallajokull in 2010 disrupted air travel in Europe for 6 days.



### test

# Example 1
marker = "AFK"
replacement = "away from keyboard"
line = "I will now go to sleep and be AFK until lunch time tomorrow."
answer = "I will now go to sleep and be away from keyboard until lunch time tomorrow."


marker_position =  line.find(marker)
replaced = line[:marker_position] + replacement + line[marker_position + len(marker):]

print answer == replaced

# Example 2 # uncomment this to test with different input
marker = "EY"
replacement = "Eyjafjallajokull"
line = "The eruption of the volcano EY in 2010 disrupted air travel in Europe for 6 days."
answer = "The eruption of the volcano Eyjafjallajokull in 2010 disrupted air travel in Europe for 6 days."

marker_position =  line.find(marker)
replaced = line[:marker_position] + replacement + line[marker_position + len(marker):]

print answer == replaced
