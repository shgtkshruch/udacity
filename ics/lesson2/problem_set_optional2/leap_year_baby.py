# A leap year baby is a baby born on Feb 29, which occurs only on a leap year.

# Define a procedure is_leap_baby that takes 3 inputs: day, month and year
# and returns True if the date is a leap day (Feb 29 in a valid leap year)
# and False otherwise.

# A year that is a multiple of 4 is a leap year unless the year is
# divisible by 100 but not a multiple of 400 (so, 1900 is not a leap
# year but 2000 and 2004 are).

def is_leap_year(year):
    if year % 4 != 0:
        return False
    elif year % 100 != 0:
        return True
    elif year % 400 != 0:
        return False
    else:
        return True

def is_leap_baby(day,month,year):
    # Write your code after this line.
    if is_leap_year(year) and month == 2 and day == 29:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# The function 'output' prints one of two statements based on whether 
# the is_leap_baby function returned True or False.

def output(status,name):
    if status:
        print "%s is one of an extremely rare species. He is a leap year baby!" % name
    else:
        print "There's nothing special about %s's birthday. He is not a leap year baby!" % name
